## Usage

When you visit the site for the first time, you are presented with the About page. This page features a picture of me and my family, as well as a bit about me and my motivations as a developer. 

Clicking on the portfolio button in the nav bar will take you to some highlights from my Github. You can click the Github icon to go to that repository, or you can click the picture to see the deployed application. For the Employee Manager, a backend app, there is no website to link to, so it goes to the github repo instead.

Clicking the resume button takes you to a list of skills and technologies that I've learned as a developer. You can also click the button below to download my resume, which is a PDF containing my work history prior to studying coding. 

Clicking the contact button will take you to a form where you can enter a message. Currently, this form is purely cosmetic per the assignment instructions. A backend will be added in the future. You can also see my email, as well as various social links.

Lastly, there is a footer which also contains social links and appears on all four pages. On the contact page, the footer is faded out, so as not to present redundant information. 

## Development
This was a passion project for me because I knew that it would be what I would be showing to future employers. I worked hard to put in lots of little details and make sure everything looked polished. 

I tried using Tailwind for the CSS framework, because it was recommended to use with React. It was my first time to use Tailwind, so the whole process felt very, very slow. I'm glad I got some experience with it though, because I think the final product looks good thanks to the greater customization options compared to Bootstrap. I would certainly consider using it again in the future. 

## Credits

I used various learning resources like Stack Overflow and W3 schools to help with other random questions I had.

I used the Tailwind documentation many, many times.
